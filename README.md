## Continuous Bag of Words Implementation

This repository contains files used to train a CBOW model from scratch using Shakespeare's work

As a result of the training, word embeddings are learned by the neural network.

### What is CBOW?

Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) is a word embedding technique part of the Word2Vec family. It is used to learn vector representations of words through a neural network by trying to predict a target word based on the surrounding context words. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words.
